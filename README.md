This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) contains [Next.js rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites) config to get rid of CORS issues of some API calls, here I used [Acrosss bridge protocol API](https://docs.across.to/v/developer-docs/developers/across-api) routes.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

Contains only one page: `app/page.tsx`. The page contains 3 buttons which serves 3 API calls of Across and show the response below.
